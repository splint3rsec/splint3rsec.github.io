<p><img src="/two/rr.jpeg#center" alt="rr">
It all happened during an exhaustive week of studying, the night before having a tough exam in Datascience, where I have to remember all kind of complex math formulas. 10 pm, tired of studying and don&rsquo;t feel sleepy yet, I decided to hunt on Synack for 1 hour before going to bed. And this was the best decision I made that night!</p>
<p>The motivation behind choosing Synack over other platforms is that my friend Conda got into the SRT and I remembered that tweet!</p>
<p><img src="/two/2.png#center" alt="Tweet"></p>
<p>I launched my <a href="https://www.synack.com/blog/introducing-launchpoint-plus-for-trusted-testing/">LP+</a> then I started looking for new targets. I noticed one with a Blitz running so I decided to give it a try. - Blitz is a kind of promotion that runs for a small period of time, where you get extra cash as a bonus depending on the severity of your report. -</p>
<h1 id="the-hunt">The hunt</h1>
<p>I opened my Burpsuite and logged into the website, To my surprise it was in a foreign language that I couldn&rsquo;t speak <strong>(Tip: foreign language websites are less tested by other hunters because most of them are lazy to translate the content)</strong> So I had a translation extension that allowed me to understand what every section was about. And as every hunter should do, I started clicking around all the possible buttons I see in front of my eyes. Tested different functionalities and became quite familiar with the platform.</p>
<p>Back to Burpsuite, I had the log of all HTTP requests that went throught that period of time, API ones were interesting. So because of the time restriction (exam at 8 am), I decided to start with business logic bugs as this website deals with money transactions, tried all different combinations of paying negative amounts, withdrawing money with a different amount, changing POST requests to GET and so on&hellip; But none were successful. I tried to look for IDOR since the requests had numerical IDs, but unfortunately there was a hash value calculated in the cookies that didn&rsquo;t allow me to do that.</p>
<h1 id="the-hidden-file-upload">The hidden file upload</h1>
<p>In a hidden section of the website, where you had to dig through the settings in order to find it, I noticed an upload button, like this one:</p>
<p><img src="/two/1.png#center" alt="file upload button"></p>
<p>This button was about sending your documents to the website&rsquo;s administrators, so that they can verify them. And another helpful thing was that this button didn&rsquo;t disappear after sending my docs, which means I can try resending them as much as I can, but only until the admins approve my documents. Good attack point!</p>
<p>So I behaved like a normal user and I uploaded a dummy file, then clicked on upload. Went to Burpsuite and saw what happens behind the scenes, the file is sent to the website in a JSON POST request, that contains two keys; <strong>filename</strong> and <strong>data</strong>, obviously the first one is about the name of our document and the second one contains the base64 value of our doc.</p>
<h1 id="the-final-shot-russian-roulette">The final shot, Russian Roulette</h1>
<p>Here I decided to finish my hunting session and append my Blind XSS payload to the filename, because&hellip; Why not, right? Even if it doesn&rsquo;t work I would still be familiar with the website and test other stuff in the next day.</p>
<p><img src="/two/tres.png" alt="JSON request"></p>
<p><strong>That XSS hunter URL is not mine</strong></p>
<h3 id="disclaimer-for-srt-members">Disclaimer for SRT members</h3>
<p>This target allowed to include third party websites such as XSS Hunter to include the testing, <strong>read the scope!!</strong> and if it&rsquo;s mentioned that you&rsquo;re not allowed to include third parties, you should not use similar websites.</p>
<h1 id="next-day">Next day</h1>
<p>So that night I went to sleep after sending the payload, and woke up at 6 to revise for the exam, went to the university and I did well! So until now I am on the safe side of not studying again for the retake XD, which means more hunting time in the future!</p>
<p>My day was normal, nothing in my inbox yet, came back home, had a 1 hour break from school and started studying again for the next exam. Usually I turn off wifi on my phone while studying to not get easily distracted, so when I finished, I turned off my laptop and went to brush my teeth. On my way I decided to turn on the wifi on my phone and check my notifications&hellip; And yes, you guessed it right, to my surprise I received 5 consecutive gmail notifications that my payload was fired somewhere in the internet :D</p>
<p>Without thinking I changed my mind to brush my teeth and started running to my laptop, turned it on and while doing that I was rechecking the phone if it was a false positive, it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be so! Now I have to be very quick in reporting to avoid falling in the duplicate zone.</p>
<h1 id="reporting">Reporting</h1>
<p>It was 11 pm when I sent a very fast report, included the PoC screenshots, cookies and steps, then submitted it. 2 days after, the VO sent a message on the report that I need to elaborate more steps in my submission, like what an attacker can do with the cookies, include XSS Hunter screenshots and so on&hellip; I did that knowing that this is definitely not a duplicate report, so I took more than enough time to write the report this time, and be as specific as possible, so that when the client reads it he will understand every small detail.</p>
<p>The same day in the evening, I received an email stating that my vulnerability was accepted!</p>
<p><img src="/two/4.png#center" alt="accepted"></p>
<p>And if this means something, it means that Synack is a very professional and fast platform, where you get paid on triage, and get professional replies on your reports. And we closed the submission with such a nice reply from the VO</p>
<p><img src="/two/5.png#center" alt="Blitz"></p>
<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>
<p>Indeed, my friend Conda motivated me to hunt and discover the platform more and more, it is hard with the exams period, but I will try my best to give it some time after that! Next goal is to reach higher levels now.</p>
<p>I want to also give a big shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmMandatory">Matthew Bryant</a> for the amazing platform <a href="https://xsshunter.com/">XSS Hunter</a> and it&rsquo;s sad to see it closing in 2023! Thanks for your efforts!</p>
