      <description>Hello everyone, welcome to my first writeup about a funny story of how some admins store their passwords nowadays.
Before you start reading, I want to mention that this finding was closed as a duplicate, so kudos to the first researcher who reported it!
Recon phase After picking a target on HackerOne (won’t disclose), I started my subdomain enumeration… For this step I don’t like to complicate things, I just follow what everyone does for gathering subdomains (which I don’t recommend, always try to be different than others to avoid dupes lol).</description>
